# virtual_keyboard_overlay

## Introduction
A dart virtual keyboard designed to float over content (such as a text game, document, etc) where maximizing content visibility and custom keyboard options / accelerators is preferred to a kiosk keyboard such as the parent repo.

Virtual keyboard provides a core set of functionality to display onscreen virtual keyboards. Managing the events sould be done on the project level. 

TODO:

Focus is to allow dragging / assigning the keyboard position to suit the needs of the user

Additional features for delegating keyboard content and behavior / callbacks beyond raw input. For example a macro button that could be user defined and persisted.

A variety of layouts and options for preferring certain ASCII characters if there's free space.
